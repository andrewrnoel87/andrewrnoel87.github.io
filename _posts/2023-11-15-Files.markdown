# Notes

<u>open(filename, mode)<u>

- "r": Opens a file for reading and places the file cursor at the start of the file.

- "w": Opens a file for writing by creating a new file. This will override existing files and place the file cursor at the start of the new file.

- "a": Opens a file for appending. This opens an existing file and places the file cursor at the end of the file.

- "r+": Opens a file for both writing and reading and places the file cursor at the start of the file.

# Reading Files Exercise

""""""

Open a filed named __"programmingExpert.txt"__ that is located in the __data__ directory and __print__ how many words are present in the file.

Escape characters like __\n__ and __\t__, periods, commas and dashes (-) are not considered words. Assume that all other text in the file that is separated by a space is a word.

The approach to this one is to replace all the characters that are not words with spaces and empty strings. Then split the string into a list using a space as the delimiter. Next subtract the number of empty strings from the total length of the list to get the final number of words.

Solution:

    text = ""

    with open("data/programmingExpert.txt", "r") as file:
        text = file.read()

    escape_characters_removed = text.replace("\n", " ").replace("\t", " ")

    punctuation_removed = escape_characters_removed.replace(",", "").replace("-", "").replace(".", "")

    words = punctuation_removed.split(" ")
    empty_strings = words.count("")
    number_of_words = len(words) - empty_strings

    print(number_of_words)

# Writing To Files Exercise

""""""

Within the current directory create a new file named __"programmingExpert.txt"__ that contains the squares of numbers in the range __1__ to __50__, each on new line.

Solution:
    
    with open("programmingExpert.txt", "w") as file:
        for i in range(1,51):
            square = i * i
            file.write(str(square) + "\n")

Alternate Solution:

    # Copyright Â© 2022 AlgoExpert LLC. All rights reserved.

    file = open("programmingExpert.txt", "w")

    for num in range(1, 51):
        square = num ** 2
        file.write(str(square) + "\n")

    file.close()
