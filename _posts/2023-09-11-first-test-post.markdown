Let's do this thing, Leeroy!

I am writing this this blog so there is a record of my software engineering journey and learning experience. In addition, I want the blog to keep me accountable for learning and to provide a level of professionalism.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
