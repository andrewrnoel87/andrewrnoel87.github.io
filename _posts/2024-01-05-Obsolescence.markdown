Today, I cover __Obsolescence__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

# Key Terms

<u>Obsolescence<u>

__Obsolescence__ refers to the process of becoming obsolete. In programming, something may become obsolete if it is no longer maintained, supported, documented or becomes outdated. It is desirable to avoid obsolescence when choosing libraries, languages, hardware and other technologies to be used in an application or project.

""""""

# Notes

- Avoid using third-party dependencies that could potentially become obsolete in the future.

- Obsolete in the context of programming is out of date, no longer recommended, no longer used, maybe no longer maintained, does not have proper documentation, or not available anymore.

- It is bad if things you are using go obsolete.

- Depend on the least amount of things as possible.

- If you can reasonably recreate code without costing you a ton of time, then do that. The fewer things you rely on the better. This minimizes the risk of things becoming obsolete.

- __Open source__ is something that is available for free. It is transparent and everyone can go look at it on the internet. It is typically supported by a community of developers. Sometimes it is supported by a company.

- Open source examples would be the React framework or the code for Visual Studio Code.

- You can volunteer your time to work on open source projects.

- Open source can be good and bad. It is very reusable, but it runs the risk of becoming obsolete.

- When looking at open source projects, ask yourself, is the project supported by a company? Is there financial backing for the project?

- Web hosting company services: Azure Cloud Service, AWS, Google Cloud, et cetera.

- Look for open source projects that have 50k-70k downloads a month.

- Avoid using early versions of software.

- Avoid using any code that is environment specific.

- Avoid using undocumented features or anything that is not tradionaly used or may become deprecated in the future.

- Make sure your dependencies are reliable.

- Avoid using any hardware or software from a company that is unlikely to support it in the future. Do not use super old stuff or stuff without a ton of current support.
