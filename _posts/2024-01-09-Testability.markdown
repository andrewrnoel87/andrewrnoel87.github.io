Today, I cover __Testability__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

""""""

# Notes

- It is important to write automated tests for software, especially for larger pieces of code. This protects the code base.

- Your code should be written in a way such that it is testable.

- Ideally, we want to be able to automatically test code.

- Consider how you can make your code easier for testing. Would it be easier to test smaller portions of the code?
