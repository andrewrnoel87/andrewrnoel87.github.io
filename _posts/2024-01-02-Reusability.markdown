Today, I cover __Reusability__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

""""""

# Notes

- Something that is __reusable__ is something that provides __repeated value__.

- Make your code reusable; your future self will thank you.

- Increase your code Reusability.

- A ton of reusable code already exists. The sort function is a good example. It is general and works on any iterable object.

- To write more reuable code, follow the previous design principles.

- Make the code __more abstract__, make it more general.

- __Increase__ its __cohesion__.

- __Reduce__ the __coupling__.
