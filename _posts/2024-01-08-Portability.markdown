Today, I cover __Portability__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

""""""

# Key Terms

<u>Portability<u>

In programming, __portability__ refers to the ability of software to be transferred from one machine, system, operating system or platform to another. When creating software it is best practice to design for portability.

""""""

# Notes

- Have your software, system, or design run on as many platforms/environments as possible. This goes with code flexiblity and reusability.

- Do not limit your code to one platform if possible.

- An iOS application is not always going to be an iOS application. It could become an Android application or a web application.

- Avoid using things that are environment specific.
