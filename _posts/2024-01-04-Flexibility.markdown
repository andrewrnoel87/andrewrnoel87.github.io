Today, I cover __Flexibility__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

""""""

# Notes

- Write code as flexible as possible. That way it can be adapted to other programs with only minor changes.

- Consider what is needed for the minimum viable product.

- Write code so it can adapt.

- Example. A flexible way of writing code would be to use a name variable instead of hard coding the name of a company in the code.

- Example. Having a seperate front-end and back-end. You want a back-end that would work with any front-end.

- Flexible code will reduce coupling, increase cohesion, and increase abstraction.

- Try not to hard code anything, leave all options available.

- Example. You could keep constant variables in a config/settings file.
