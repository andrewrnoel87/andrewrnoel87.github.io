Studying from the programmingexpert.io course today. The course is teaching using Python. I am using the course to refresh many of the things I learned in college. 

I went through Data Types, Comments, Variables and Printing, Console Input, and Arithmetic Operators before I started this blog.

Today I covered Type Conversions, Conditions, Compound Conditions, Conditionals, Lists, and Strings.
