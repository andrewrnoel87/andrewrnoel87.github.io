Today I'm setting up the blog.

Looks like Jekyll builds the website and
GitHub holds the website files in a repository and gives the public access
to the website.

I use Visual Studio Code to create my .markdown files for the posts. Then, I use GitHub Desktop to push the files up to GitHub.

I like to listen to LoFi music as I study/work.

GFuel also seems to be important to the process.
