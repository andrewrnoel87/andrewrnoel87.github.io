# Key Terms

<u>Child Class<u>

When a class __A__ inherits from class __B__, we say that class __A__ is a _child class_ of __B__.

<u>Parent Class<u>

When a class __A__ inherits from class __B__, we say that class __B__ is a _parent class_ of __A__.

<u>Polymorphism<u>

Polymorphism is a term originating from biology, where _poly_ means many and _morphism_ means forms (this is a simplification). In programming, polymorphism refers to the ability for an object to behave in differnet ways and exhibit different behaviour based on the context it's ised in.

<u>Method Overriding<u>

Method __overriding__ is when a programmer re-defines a method on a class that was already defined in its parent class(es).

# Notes

- Child class, subclass and derived class are all synonymous for a class that inherits from another class.

- Parent class, superclass and base class are all synonymous for a class that is inherited from.
