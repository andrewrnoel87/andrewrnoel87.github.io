Today, I cover __Reuse__ from the [programmingexpert.io][course-site] course.

""""""

# Notes

- Use other peoples code. Avoid reinventing the wheel.

- Use proven solutions. Your own implementation is likely to be subpar. 

- Before writing a graphic library or a web framework, do research first. See if there is code out there that can be reused.

- Using an existing framework is likely to make your code more scalable, flexible, and reusable.
